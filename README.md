# GenAlgorithms

This is implementation og genetic algorithm in python. The whole program takes as an input the sentence and then tries to recreate it by generating strings as chromosomes and then performs pairing and mutating on each generation as in classical genetic algorithm.

## TODO
I have been thinking about adding possibility of giving a string as an argument to make it work.

## Technologies
Python 3.6
Numpy

## Status
Finished versison 2.1, currently the most part of work is done in genalgorithmver2, in which I wrapped it into class and changed the transform method.
